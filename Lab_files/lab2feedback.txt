User Stories:

"As a player although functionality is important, smooth animations would make the game more fun and satisfying to play."
Is more of a non-functional requirement than a user story

"As an advantage player, I want to be able to practice my card counting as well as play. user story "
advantage -> advanced

____ Sprint 1 ____
Tasks:

"11. Register - save accounts a db securly"
If you have a DB related task, you need a DB schema in your docs as well.

"17. Game engine - Game rules"
There's some duplication.

Overall it looks like the tasks are not intended for actual planning.
Which is not atypical, or unreasonable, but do know they could serve a purpose.
	// That is tasks are split to meet quota, which is fine.
	// But keep in mind we only have three sprints, there's one group doing:
	// sprint 1 -> first half, sprint 2 -> second half, sprint 3 -> adapt based on feedback / polish.
	// Which is about right if you guys want to finish a project you can show off.
	// Otherwise it will wind up unpolished.
	//
	// But I'll leave the planning up to you guys.

Tests:

good

____ conc. ____

If you're planning on showing the project off on a resume you might want to take on a bit more first sprint.

On Thursday you'll need a DB schema for any tasks / and a UI wire frame.

But the project looks feasible, and your docs exist.
